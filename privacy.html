    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="data-update"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 27/05/2025</div>
    <p>
      Thank you for using <strong>DeedPlus</strong>, a mobile application
      designed to help users calculate deed registration costs based on the
      provided plot value and deed type (e.g., Sale, Gift, Exchange, etc.). This
      app is developed using Jetpack Compose and is available for Android
      devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how
      <strong>DeedPlus</strong> handles information and data when you use our
      app.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      any personal or sensitive data on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
      The app allows users to
      <strong
        >download deed-related PDF files from official or public internet
        sources</strong
      >. These files are accessed through internet connectivity and opened via
      an in-app or external PDF viewer.
    </p>
    <p>We do not track or store the content of these downloads.</p>

    <h2>3. Use of AdMob (Advertising)</h2>
